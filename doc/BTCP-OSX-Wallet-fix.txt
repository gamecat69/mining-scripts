For people on MAC that can't get the wallet to work, run the following in terminal:

1. Move the extracted content to your application folder. 

2. cd /Applications/BitcoinPrivateDesktopWallet.app/Contents

3. chmod +x btcpd; chmod +x btcp-cli

4. java -jar Java/BitcoinPrivateDesktopWallet.jar

They didn't make the executable files executable -.-
